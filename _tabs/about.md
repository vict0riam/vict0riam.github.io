## **Hello there! I'm Victoria!**


My journey into cybersecurity comes from a lifelong love for technology and a sharp eye for detail. With a background in psychology, I have a natural curiosity about how people think and behaveâ€”which comes in handy when spotting risks and understanding social engineering tactics. Whether it was managing complex data as an underwriter, digging into audits, or leading therapy sessions, Iâ€™ve always been driven to solve problems and think critically under pressure. Now, Iâ€™m excited to bring those skills into cybersecurity, combining technical know-how with behavioral insight to help protect and secure digital spaces.


As an explorer in the vast world of cyber security, navigating through challenges and uncovering new tools and techniques. Armed with curiosity and determination, I'm diving into vulnerability assessments, security challenges, and continuous learning as I pursue the Google Cybersecurity Certificate-all while expanding my project portfolio. 


This space is my map, filled with projects and reflections marking each milestone in this evolving adventure. Ready to explore with me?
